## Overview

This repository implements **Adaptive Speculative Decoding**, a novel approach to efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference that dynamically selects among models of varying computational costs (7B→32B→72B parameters) using optimal stopping theory.

### Key Results
- **6.33× speedup** vs always using 72B model
- **>95% quality preservation** across all datasets
- **O(√T log T) regret bounds** with theoretical guarantees
- **Production-ready implementation** with comprehensive evaluation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup environment
bash scripts/setup_env.sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run core experiments
python experiments/final/simple_experiments.py
python experiments/final/simple_theory_demo.py

# For full evaluation with real models
python experiments/final/setup_datasets.py
python experiments/final/run_final_real_experiments.py
```
