# Academic Refactoring Summary

## Major Changes

### 1. Theoretical Framework (NEW)
- `src/theory/`: Complete theoretical formulation
  - Optimal stopping theory with dynamic programming
  - Regret bounds: O(√T log T) proven
  - Sample complexity: O(1/ε²) for PAC learning

### 2. Model Architecture Simplification
- Switched from Llama to Qwen3 family (7B→14B→32B→72B)
- Simplified quality predictor: 32-dim MLP only
- Removed ensemble methods and complex features

### 3. Rigorous Evaluation
- `src/statistical_evaluation.py`: Proper hypothesis testing
  - Paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction
  - Effect size computation (Cohen's d)
  - Power analysis and confidence intervals

### 4. Essential Baselines Only
- Oracle (upper bound)
- Random (lower bound)
- Fixed-k (traditional approach)
- Simple threshold-based

### 5. Core Experiments
- Regret analysis (theory vs empirical)
- Quality-speed tradeoff curves
- Cross-domain generalization
- Statistical significance testing

## What Was Removed
- 24-hour continuous operation tests
- Complex 6-dimensional task taxonomy
- Dynamic cost optimization
- Production-specific optimizations
- Excessive engineering complexity

## Key Files
- `demonstrate_theory.py`: Theoretical results visualization
- `run_core_experiments.py`: Minimal experiment set for paper
- `src/minimal_adaptive_decoder.py`: Clean implementation
- `PAPER_ABSTRACT.md`: 150-word abstract focusing on theory

## Result
A streamlined, theoretically-grounded implementation suitable for top-tier academic conferences, with provable guarantees and rigorous evaluation.
